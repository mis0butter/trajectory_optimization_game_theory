# trajectory_optimization_game_theory
For game theory class 

### Schedule 

Bullet points are goals to complete by the date 

Oct 23: 
- simulator in Julia with propagator 
- 2-body (J2 and J3) 
- model chaser + evader 
- add fuel/maneuver limits 
- min distance between satellites 

... 
- experiment with plotting tools at some point 


Nov 27 
- code done 

Nov 28 
- presentation done 

Nov 29
- present 

## Oct 17, 2023 

### Actions 

Sofia: 
- simulator in Julia with propagator 
- 2-body (J2 and J3) 
- model chaser + evader 

Junette: 
- add fuel/maneuver limits 
- min distance between satellites 

### Notes 

The point of the class is: 
- non-cooperative game theory 
- minimize different objective functions 
  - based on fuel 

Minimum success criteria for simulator dynamics:
- IC target 
- IC chaser 
- propagator 
- 2-body dynamics 
- fuel/maneuver limits 
- min distance between sets 
- shadow (observability) 

Nice to have: 
- shadow model (observability) 
- atmosphere (cannonball)
